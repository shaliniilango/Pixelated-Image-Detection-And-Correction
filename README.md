Introduction
This project focuses on detecting and correcting pixelation in images using advanced image processing techniques. The goal is to identify pixelated images and enhance their quality using deep learning models.

Problem Statement
Pixelation in images is a common issue that affects the quality and clarity of digital images. This project aims to develop a solution that can automatically detect and correct pixelated images, restoring them to their original quality.

Unique Idea Brief (Solution)
Our solution combines a pixelation detection model with state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques, including ESRGAN and Real-ESRGAN. The detection model identifies pixelated images, and the super-resolution models enhance these images to improve their quality. This dual approach ensures accurate detection and effective correction of pixelated images.

Features Offered
Pixelation Detection: Detect whether an image is pixelated.
Image Correction: Correct pixelated images using ESRGAN and Real-ESRGAN.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): User-friendly interface for loading, detecting, and correcting images.
Data Visualization: Visualize the pixelation detection results with bar charts.
Image Comparison: Compare original, ESRGAN-corrected, and Real-ESRGAN-corrected images.
Process Flow
Load Image: User loads an image using the GUI.
Detect Pixelation: The detection model processes the image to determine if it is pixelated.
Visualize Results: Display the detection result and visualize it with a bar chart.
Correct Image: If the image is pixelated, correct it using ESRGAN and Real-ESRGAN.
Display Corrected Image: Display the corrected image and compare it with the original.
